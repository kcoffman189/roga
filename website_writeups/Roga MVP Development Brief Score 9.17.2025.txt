📄 Roga MVP Development Brief: ScoreCard & Coaching
🎯 Purpose

Refine the ScoreCard system to deliver coaching-first feedback that teaches Question Intelligence (QI), not just grades it. This is Roga’s core differentiator and must feel sharp, supportive, and growth-oriented by MVP launch.

🔑 Current State

Backend returns: score, rubric breakdown, Pro Tip, Suggested Upgrade, badge.

Tone: sometimes generic, not consistently tied to user’s actual question.

Latency: ~5–8 seconds, acceptable but noticeable.

Error handling: basic.

🛠️ Required Enhancements
1. Feedback Structure (Backend Prompt Engineering)

Every ScoreCard must return these five components:

Positive Reinforcement → Highlight what the user did well.

Dimension Focus → Call out 1–2 QI dimensions needing improvement.

Pro Tip → Short, actionable coaching advice.

Suggested Upgrade → Rewrite of the user’s question showing a stronger version.

Score + Rubric Breakdown → 0–100 score + ratings across clarity, depth, curiosity, relevance, empathy.

2. Contextualization (Backend + CLO Input)

Feedback must reference the user’s actual words in both reinforcement and Suggested Upgrade.

CLO to provide sub-criteria for each QI dimension so feedback feels specific (e.g., Clarity = concise + avoids jargon).

Backend prompt must tie feedback explicitly to at least one QI dimension.

3. Tone & Variety (Backend + Editor Input)

Editor to draft a Coaching Lexicon (approved phrases for encouragement, pro tips, upgrades).

Backend should randomize among phrasing templates to avoid repetition.

Tone must be warm, constructive, and conversational (mentor, not judge).

4. Technical Enhancements (CTO Lead)

Enforce strict JSON schema with fields: {reinforcement, dimensions, pro_tip, suggested_upgrade, score, rubric}.

Add prompt instructions to ensure dimension coverage.

Add multiple Pro Tip templates to backend prompt for variety.

Future-ready: allow dimension weighting if we expand scoring model.

5. Testing & QA

Founder review of 10–15 sample ScoreCards.

Must feel like coaching, not grading.

If feedback feels generic → refine prompt.

If Suggested Upgrade doesn’t use user’s words → reject and fix.

📚 Role Breakdown

CTO → Backend prompt structure, JSON enforcement, integration.

CLO → Expand QI dimension definitions into sub-criteria.

Editor → Build Coaching Lexicon + Pro Tip variations.

Founder → Final review for “does this feel like coaching?”

🚀 MVP Success Criteria

Every ScoreCard consistently delivers the 5-part structure.

Feedback feels specific, contextual, and encouraging.

Suggested Upgrade always shows a clearer, stronger question.

Rubric breakdown ties directly to the 5 QI dimensions.

Tone is distinctly Roga: modern, approachable, mentor-like.
