📝 Roga Project — Branding & Tailwind Handover Document

Date: September 9, 2025
Owner: CTO (handover to engineering team)

1. Current Status
Application

Frontend (Vercel, Next.js)

Running at https://roga.me
.

Root Directory correctly set to apps/web in Vercel.

Build command: npm run build.

Tailwind/PostCSS configs present but CSS is not being compiled in production (plain HTML view).

Global CSS (globals.css) imported into layout.tsx.

Backend (Fly.io, FastAPI)

Live at https://roga-api.fly.dev
.

Dynamic scoring endpoint (/score) integrated with ChatGPT API.

Last deploy attempt hit builder timeout (deadline_exceeded).

Backend functionality otherwise unchanged since last good deploy.

Styling/Branding

Roga brand tokens (colors, radii, shadows, fonts) defined in Tailwind config.

globals.css includes @tailwind directives, brand CSS vars, and utility class mappings (.btn-primary, .card, .badge).

Assets: Favicon and logos stored in apps/web/public/brand/ and apps/web/public/favicon.ico.

Current production site not styled (Tailwind build not running on Vercel).

3. Updates Made

Fixed frontend/backend integration for dynamic scoring (score, rubric, pro tip, suggested upgrade, badge).

Added branding assets (logos, favicons, OG image).

Introduced Tailwind theme config with brand colors, radius, shadows, fonts.

Added global styles (globals.css) with @tailwind directives and custom utility classes (.btn-primary, .badge, etc.).

Configured Vercel project settings → Root Directory set to apps/web, proper build command.

Attempted multiple redeploys, but Tailwind CSS not being compiled in production.

4. Known Issues

Frontend (Vercel)

Styles are missing in production → Tailwind/PostCSS not running.

/_next/static/chunks/*.css does not include Tailwind utilities (--tw-, .text-4xl, etc.).

Most likely cause: tailwindcss, postcss, and autoprefixer devDependencies missing in apps/web/package.json (Vercel builds each package independently).

Backend (Fly.io)

Last deploy attempt failed with deadline_exceeded (builder timeout).

Service is still available but may be slightly behind latest code.

Favicon

favicon.ico is in place, but browser tab icon not updating due to caching.

5. Next Steps (Team To-Do)
Frontend

Install Tailwind/PostCSS dependencies in apps/web

cd apps/web
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
cd ../..
git add apps/web/package.json apps/web/package-lock.json
git commit -m "apps/web: add Tailwind/PostCSS dev deps"
git push origin main


Verify Vercel build logs

Look for tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer in dependency tree.

Ensure no warnings like Unknown at rule @tailwind.

Redeploy → After successful build, check CSS chunk for --tw- utilities.

Clean up diagnostic code (if any test outline rules were added).

Backend

Retry Fly.io deploy with:

flyctl deploy --app roga-api --remote-only
# or fallback
flyctl deploy --app roga-api --local-only


Confirm endpoint health at https://roga-api.fly.dev/score
.

General

After Tailwind is working, move to Step 3 (Fonts) → integrate Poppins, Inter, Merriweather via next/font/google.

Add production monitoring (Vercel analytics, Fly logs, Sentry optional).

Add small visual version marker in footer (Brand v1) so it’s obvious when changes are live.

6. Handoff Notes

All prior fixes (dynamic scoring, ScoreCard integration, backend API wiring) are working end-to-end.

The main blocker is frontend styling not compiling in Vercel. Focus first on dev dependencies + verifying build logs.

Backend Fly.io issues are secondary; they don’t affect styling.

✅ Once Tailwind is compiling, the site will show the new Roga brand look (Fog background, Coal text, Teal buttons, Violet hover, Coral badges, rounded cards).
