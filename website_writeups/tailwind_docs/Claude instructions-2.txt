Final Refinement Instructions for Claude Code
1. Fix Feature Cards Layout
Current Issue: The three feature cards (Daily Challenge, Deep Practice, Streaks & Badges) are missing from the current design
Fix Needed:

Add the three white/cream colored cards in a horizontal row below the hero section
Cards should be positioned in the teal background area, not in the white section
Each card needs its colored icon (orange timer, purple chat bubble, red trophy)
Cards should have proper spacing between them and rounded corners

2. Reorganize Content Structure
Current Issue: The individual sections are scattered in the white area
Fix Needed:

Move all three feature cards up into the teal section
Remove the individual "Daily Challenge" section that's currently in the white area
The teal section should contain: Logo, Hero text, Buttons, AND the three feature cards

3. Adjust Section Heights
Current Issue: Too much white space, teal section ends too early
Fix Needed:

Extend the teal background to accommodate the three feature cards
The teal section should take up about 80-85% of the viewport
Reduce the white footer section to just contain the tagline and footer links

4. Complete the Card Content
Missing Elements:

Add the colorful icons to each card (orange clock/timer, purple speech bubble, red trophy)
Ensure each card has the proper title and description text
Cards should be evenly spaced in a row

5. Footer Content Placement
Current Issue: Footer elements are missing
Add to white section:

"Roga trains Question Intelligence â€” the art of asking better questions." (left-aligned)
"Privacy Terms Contact" links (right-aligned)

6. Remove Duplicate Content

Remove the standalone "Daily Challenge" section currently in the white area
Remove any other individual feature sections that aren't part of the card layout

Key Point: The main difference is that ALL content except the footer should be in the teal section - the three feature cards should sit within the teal background, not below it in white space.
