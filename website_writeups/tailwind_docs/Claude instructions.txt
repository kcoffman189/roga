## Instructions for Roga.me Website Redesign

**Transform the current layout from a minimal white design to a vibrant teal-themed hero section with card-based feature presentation.**

### 1. Background and Color Scheme Changes
- Change the main background from light gray/white to a vibrant teal/turquoise color (#20B2AA or similar)
- The hero section should have this teal background covering the top 70% of the viewport
- Add a white/cream section at the bottom for footer content

### 2. Logo and Header Positioning
- Move the Roga logo to the top-left corner instead of center
- Keep the question mark icon in a rounded square format
- Logo should be white text on the teal background

### 3. Hero Content Layout
- Center-align all hero text content
- Make "The art of asking" much larger (approximately 3-4x current size) and white
- Keep the subtitle "Sharpen your Question Intelligence..." but make it white and slightly smaller
- Maintain the two buttons ("Start Daily Challenge" and "Learn More") but ensure they're properly styled with rounded corners
- The "Learn More" button should be outlined/transparent with white border

### 4. Feature Cards Redesign
- Transform the current left-aligned list format into three horizontal cards
- Cards should be white/cream colored with rounded corners
- Arrange cards in a row: Daily Challenge, Deep Practice, Streaks & Badges
- Each card should contain:
  - A colorful icon at the top (orange timer for Daily Challenge, purple chat bubble for Deep Practice, red trophy for Streaks & Badges)
  - Bold title text
  - Description text below

### 5. Card Content Updates
- Daily Challenge: "2-3 minute scenarios with fast feedback" 
- Deep Practice: "10-15 minute multi-round roleplay"
- Streaks & Badges: "Keep your curiosity going"
- Remove the "+10 Insight XP" badge from the current design

### 6. Footer Section
- Add a white/cream section at the bottom
- Include the tagline: "Roga trains Question Intelligence â€” the art of asking better questions"
- Add footer links: Privacy, Terms, Contact (right-aligned)

### 7. Spacing and Layout
- Increase vertical spacing between sections
- Ensure the hero section takes up significant viewport height
- Cards should have generous padding and spacing between them
- Overall layout should feel more spacious and visually impactful

### 8. Typography
- Use larger, bolder fonts throughout
- Ensure good contrast between white text and teal background
- Maintain readability while making the design more visually striking

**The goal is to transform from a minimal, list-based layout to a bold, card-based design with a strong teal hero section that immediately captures attention.**
