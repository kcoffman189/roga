## Instructions for Claude Code - Roga.me Website Updates

### SINGLE FOCUS: Change Text Colors to White

**ONLY make this change - do not modify anything else:**

1. **Change the "roga" text in the top left corner to white color**
   - Apply `color: white;` or `color: #ffffff;` to the roga logo text

2. **Change "The art of asking" headline to white color**
   - Apply `color: white;` or `color: #ffffff;` to this text

3. **Change "Sharpen your Question Intelligence with daily challenges and deep practice." subtitle to white color**
   - Apply `color: white;` or `color: #ffffff;` to this text

**Do not change:**
- Font sizes
- Positioning
- Card sizes
- Button spacing
- Any other styling

**Goal**: Make these three text elements clearly visible as white text against the teal background.
