## Instructions for Claude Code - Roga.me Website Updates

### 1. Logo Font and Styling Updates
- Change the "roga" logo font to **Georgia serif**: `font-family: 'Georgia', serif;`
- **Double the current size** of both the logo icon and "roga" text in the upper left
- Add **padding/margin** to the logo container to create space from the absolute upper left corner of the screen (suggest 20-30px from top and left edges)

### 2. Logo Positioning
- Ensure the enlarged logo maintains proper spacing from screen edges
- Logo should not touch the very corner - add appropriate margin/padding for breathing room

### 3. Feature Cards Layout Fix
**Critical**: The three feature cards (Daily Challenge, Deep Practice, Streaks & Badges) must be arranged **horizontally in a row, side by side**
- **NOT stacked vertically** 
- Use flexbox or CSS Grid to create a horizontal row layout
- Add **spacing/gaps between the cards** (suggest 20-30px gap)
- Cards should be evenly distributed across the width
- All three cards should be visible side-by-side on desktop screens

### 4. Typography Color Updates
Ensure the following text elements use **white font color**:
- **"roga"** logo text (upper left)
- **"The art of asking"** (main headline)  
- **"Sharpen your Question Intelligence with daily challenges and deep practice."** (subtitle text)

All of these text elements should have high contrast against the teal background.

### 5. Layout Verification
- Confirm the three cards are positioned at the bottom of the teal section
- Ensure cards maintain their white/cream background with colored icons
- Verify proper responsive behavior for the horizontal card layout

**Priority Focus**: Fix the card layout from vertical stacking to horizontal side-by-side arrangement with proper spacing between cards.
