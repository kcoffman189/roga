## Instructions for Claude Code - Roga.me Website Updates

### 1. Logo Typography Updates
- **Triple the current font size** of the "roga" text in the upper left corner
- Change the "roga" text color to **white**
- Ensure it maintains the Georgia serif font

### 2. Feature Cards Dimension Changes
- Resize the three feature cards to be **1.25 times taller than they are wide** 
- Transform from current wide/short format to **tall/skinny format**
- This creates vertical space for future icon placement in each card
- Maintain the horizontal side-by-side layout
- Keep spacing between cards

### 3. Main Headline Typography
- **Increase the font size** of "The art of asking" (suggest making it larger/more prominent)
- Change text color to **white**
- Apply **Georgia serif font**: `font-family: 'Georgia', serif;`

### 4. Subtitle Typography  
- Apply **Georgia serif font** to "Sharpen your Question Intelligence with daily challenges and deep practice."
- Change text color to **white**

### 5. Button Updates
- **Remove the black border/outline** from the "Start Daily Challenge" button
- **Change the "Learn More" button text** to say **"Deep Practice"**
- **Add spacing/margin between** the "Start Daily Challenge" and "Deep Practice" buttons (suggest 15-20px gap)

### 6. Footer Typography
- Apply **Georgia serif font** to the footer text: "Roga trains Question Intelligence â€” the art of asking better questions."
- Keep this text in the white/cream footer section

### 7. Font Consistency Check
Ensure Georgia serif font is now applied to:
- "roga" logo
- "The art of asking" headline  
- "Sharpen your Question Intelligence..." subtitle
- Footer tagline text
