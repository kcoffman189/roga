## Instructions for Claude Code - Roga.me Website Updates

### 1. Logo Text Size and Color Fix
- **Triple the font size** of the "roga" text in the upper left corner (this appears to not have been applied yet)
- Change the "roga" text color to **white** (ensure this is actually implemented)
- Keep the Georgia serif font

### 2. Logo Position Adjustment
- **Move the entire Roga logo and "roga" text slightly down and to the right**
- Increase the top and left margins/padding by an additional 10-15px from current position

### 3. Feature Cards Size Reduction
- **Reduce the overall size of all three feature cards by one-third (33%)**
- Maintain the tall/skinny proportions (1.25 times taller than wide)
- Keep the horizontal side-by-side layout
- Preserve spacing between cards

### 4. Hero Text Color Fix
Ensure **white text color** is applied to:
- **"The art of asking"** headline
- **"Sharpen your Question Intelligence with daily challenges and deep practice."** subtitle
Both text elements should be clearly white against the teal background

### 5. Button Spacing Fix
- **Add margin/spacing between the "Start Daily Challenge" and "Deep Practice" buttons**
- Buttons should not be touching each other
- Suggest 15-20px horizontal gap between the buttons
- Ensure both buttons remain centered as a group

### 6. Verification Checklist
- Confirm "roga" text is significantly larger and white
- Confirm all hero section text is white and readable
- Confirm cards are noticeably smaller but still properly proportioned
- Confirm buttons have clear separation between them
