Roga Daily Challenge Feedback — Implementation Guide
🎯 Purpose

The current feedback section is too simple (QI Skill, one improvement, one pro tip). We need more robust coaching feedback to:

Teach Question Intelligence (QI) skills in context.

Motivate users with actionable upgrades.

Build stickiness through encouragement and progress framing.

🧩 New Feedback Structure

Each Daily Challenge attempt should return the following fields:

{
  "qi_score": {
    "overall": 4,
    "clarity": 4,
    "depth": 3,
    "relevance": 5,
    "empathy": 2
  },
  "strengths": "You showed strong clarifying instincts — you reduced ambiguity and made the task clearer.",
  "improvement": "Add depth by asking why this step matters, not just what it is.",
  "coaching_moment": "Clarifying questions reduce uncertainty, but deep questions uncover hidden assumptions. Pairing both makes your question much more powerful.",
  "technique_spotlight": {
    "name": "The Clarifier",
    "description": "A clarifying question works best when it targets missing details. Aim for precision, not repetition."
  },
  "example_upgrades": [
    "What specific deliverable do we need to complete first?",
    "Which part of the process is slowing us down the most?",
    "Who needs to approve this step before we move forward?"
  ],
  "progress_message": "🌟 Nice work — you’re on track toward Clarifier Level 2. Keep sharpening your questions!"
}

🎨 UI Layout (Suggested)

Header:

Show QI Score prominently (overall 1–5 stars or numeric).

Include sub-scores in a compact grid (Clarity, Depth, Relevance, Empathy).

Body Sections:

✓ Strengths → short positive feedback.

→ Improvement → one targeted improvement suggestion.

📖 Coaching Moment → 1–2 sentences teaching nugget from the QI library.

🔍 Roga Technique Spotlight → highlight taxonomy skill (name + description).

⚡ Example Upgrades → list 2–3 stronger question examples.

🌟 Progress Message → gamified encouragement tied to skill level.

🔗 Integration Notes

Source of Content:

Feedback templates should be stored in the QI Knowledge Base (taxonomy-linked).

Backend should select appropriate template based on detected skill + performance case.

Consistency:

Always return all fields, even if empty (so frontend doesn’t break).

Ensure example upgrades rotate (to avoid repetition).

Scoring:

qi_score.overall = 1–5 (derived from taxonomy rubric).

Sub-scores map to QI dimensions (Clarity, Depth, Relevance, Empathy).

Gamification Hook:

Tie progress_message to XP + streak logic.

Example: “You’re on track for Clarifier Level 2.”

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Feedback screen displays all sections in order.

Example upgrades are shown as a list, not a single line.

Coaching moment + technique spotlight rotate per scenario.

Sub-scores are visible but secondary to overall QI Score.

Progress message matches gamification system (levels, badges).

This structure ensures every user feels like they’re getting personalized coaching, not just a generic note. It also builds your QI dataset (every feedback instance logged with taxonomy + score).
