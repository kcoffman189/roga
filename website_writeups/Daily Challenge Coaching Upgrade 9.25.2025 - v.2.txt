🛠️ Roga Daily Challenge — Coaching Engine Upgrade
1. Goal

Strengthen the quality and consistency of coaching feedback by enforcing stricter scoring, applying a universal 6-part coaching framework, and standardizing the “Roga voice.” This ensures that users get credible, instructional, and motivating coaching instead of inflated or overly polite feedback.

2. Key Changes
A. Enforce Stricter Scoring Rules

Cap vague or closed questions at ≤2/5 (≤40/100 overall).

Scoring scale (apply across all QI skills):

1–2 = Weak (vague, closed, trivial)

3 = Okay (surface-level but workable)

4 = Strong (clear, specific, open-ended)

5 = Excellent (precise, layered, invites deep insight)

Ensure subscores (Clarity, Depth, Relevance, Empathy) cannot exceed the cap if a major flaw is detected.

B. Universal Coaching Framework (6-part arc)

Every feedback response must include these six sections, in this order:

QI Skill Detected → name skill + quality rating

Example: "QI Skill: Clarifying (attempted, but vague)"

Strengths → one positive element from the question

Example: "You showed curiosity by signaling confusion — that’s the first step toward clarifying."

Improvement Area → name the gap, tied to QI taxonomy

Example: "Your clarifier was too broad — the teacher won’t know which part confused you."

Coaching Nugget → 1–2 sentences of mini-teaching (from QI Library)

Example: "Strong clarifiers reduce uncertainty when they point to the missing detail, not the whole message."

Example Upgrades → 2–3 better alternatives, always phrased as questions

Example:

"Could you clarify the part about the project requirements?"

"Which sections do we need to complete first?"

"What does the final product need to include?"

Progress Note → motivational + gamified hook

Example: "🌟 Clarifier Level 1 → Add one specific detail to move toward Level 2."

C. Roga Coaching Voice (apply universally)

Direct → call out weaknesses clearly.

Encouraging → normalize mistakes and encourage practice.

Instructional → always show how to fix the issue.

Modern & approachable → conversational, not academic.

Concise → ≤120 words per full feedback block.

3. Technical Implementation
A. Feedback Schema (JSON)

Update coaching endpoint to always return feedback in this structure:

{
  "qi_score": {
    "overall": 20,
    "clarity": 1,
    "depth": 1,
    "relevance": 3,
    "empathy": 2
  },
  "skill_detected": "Clarifying (attempted, but vague)",
  "strengths": "You showed curiosity by signaling confusion — that’s the first step toward clarifying.",
  "improvement_area": "Your clarifier was too vague — the teacher won’t know which part confused you.",
  "coaching_nugget": "Strong clarifiers reduce uncertainty when they point to the missing detail, not the whole message.",
  "example_upgrades": [
    "Could you clarify the part about the project requirements?",
    "Which sections do we need to complete first?",
    "What does the final product need to include?"
  ],
  "progress_note": "🌟 Clarifier Level 1 → Add one specific detail to move toward Level 2."
}

B. Logic Layer

Add validation so that weak/closed questions automatically trigger low scores and stricter coaching.

Pull Coaching Nuggets and Progress Notes from a QI Library (content bank) rather than generating ad hoc → ensures consistency.

Randomize Example Upgrades from a curated set so users see variation without drift in quality.

C. Reuse Across Features

Daily Challenge should call the same coaching engine endpoint used in Roga Sessions → one universal coaching pipeline, one consistent voice.

4. QA / Acceptance Criteria

 Weak questions (“Wait, what?”) score ≤2/5 (overall ≤40/100).

 Feedback always includes the six sections in correct order.

 No feedback response exceeds ~120 words.

 At least 2 Example Upgrades always returned.

 Coaching nuggets and progress notes come from a shared library.

 Same structure and voice apply across Daily Challenges and Sessions.

✅ Deliverable: Once implemented, Daily Challenge coaching will shift from “polite feedback” → “direct, instructional coaching”, building user trust and creating a consistent Roga learning voice.
