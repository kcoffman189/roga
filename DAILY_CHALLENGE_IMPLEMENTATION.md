# Daily Challenge Coaching Upgrade v3 - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the Daily Challenge Coaching Upgrade as specified in the requirements document dated 9.15.2025. This upgrade introduces a sophisticated two-step pipeline for providing dynamic, AI-driven, taxonomy-consistent coaching feedback.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. QI Knowledge Base (qi_kb_seed.json)
- **Location**: `apps/api/qi_kb_seed.json`
- **Content**: Complete taxonomy, feedback templates, coaching nuggets, example upgrades, and style constraints
- **Skills Covered**: clarifying, probing, follow_up, comparative, open_question, closed_question
- **Templates**: Good/needs_work feedback for each skill type
- **Examples**: Easy and medium difficulty upgrade examples

### 2. Backend FastAPI Implementation (main.py)

#### New Models Added:
- `ClassifyRequest` / `ClassifyResponse` - For question classification
- `CoachRequest` / `DailyChallengeCoachFeedback` - For coaching feedback
- `Scores` - 1-5 scale scoring for clarity/depth/relevance/empathy/overall
- `DailyChallengeFeedbackResponse` - Complete response wrapper

#### New Endpoints:
1. **`POST /classify`** - Analyzes user questions and provides:
   - Detected skills (clarifying, probing, etc.)
   - Sub-scores (1-5 scale for each dimension)
   - Issues detected (too_vague, closed_question, etc.)
   - Justification for scoring

2. **`POST /coach`** - Generates coaching feedback based on classification:
   - Retrieves relevant coaching assets
   - Provides structured feedback
   - Includes technique spotlight and example upgrades
   - Implements fallback behavior

3. **`POST /daily-challenge-feedback`** - Complete pipeline:
   - Combines classify + coach in one call
   - Provides full Daily Challenge v3 feedback structure
   - Includes metadata and validation

#### Helper Functions:
- `retrieve_assets()` - Gets coaching materials for specific skills
- `validate_and_cap_scores()` - Applies rubric rules and caps
- `call_llm_json()` - OpenAI integration with JSON schema validation
- `check_content_filters()` - Content safety validation

#### Configuration:
- Environment variable support for all limits and flags
- Strict scoring enforcement (`ROGA_STRICT_SCORING`)
- Configurable example counts and word limits

### 3. Frontend Integration

#### New Components:
- **`DailyChallengeScoreCard.tsx`** - Enhanced feedback display component
  - Visual score indicators with color coding
  - Structured sections for all feedback elements
  - Modern, accessible design following Roga brand guidelines

#### Updated Pages:
- **`game/page.tsx`** - Added Daily Challenge v3 mode
  - New mode toggle for v3 vs legacy systems
  - Integration with new feedback pipeline
  - Fallback handling for API errors

#### New Actions:
- **`game/actions.ts`** - Server actions for API integration
  - `getFeedback()` - Complete pipeline call
  - `classifyQuestion()` / `coachQuestion()` - Individual step calls
  - TypeScript types for all response structures

### 4. JSON Schemas
Implemented strict OpenAI-compatible JSON schemas for:
- Classification responses (`CLASSIFY_SCHEMA`)
- Coaching feedback (`DAILY_COACH_SCHEMA`)
- Both schemas include validation and required field enforcement

### 5. Validation & Guardrails
- **Rubric Rules**: Automatic score capping for vague/closed questions
- **Content Filters**: Banned topic detection
- **Length Control**: Configurable word limits
- **Deterministic Settings**: Controlled temperature and parameters
- **Fallback Responses**: Graceful degradation when AI calls fail

## Key Features Delivered

### Two-Step Pipeline
1. **Classification** (Low temperature 0.2): Objective analysis
2. **Coaching** (Moderate temperature 0.5): Creative, helpful feedback

### RAG-Enhanced Coaching
- Retrieves relevant coaching assets based on detected skills
- Provides contextual feedback templates
- Offers skill-specific example upgrades

### Comprehensive Feedback Structure
- **QI Scores**: 5-point scale for multiple dimensions
- **Strengths**: Positive reinforcement
- **Improvement**: Specific guidance
- **Coaching Moment**: Educational insight
- **Technique Spotlight**: Skill explanation
- **Example Upgrades**: 2-3 concrete alternatives
- **Progress Message**: Gamified encouragement

### Quality Assurance
- Server-side validation against JSON schemas
- Content filtering and brand compliance
- Length limits and formatting controls
- Fallback responses for reliability

## Test Coverage

### Test Vector Implementation
Created `test_daily_challenge.py` to validate the "Wait, what?" test case:

**Expected Results for "Wait, what?":**
- Issues: `["too_vague", "closed_question"]`
- Overall score: ≤ 2 (due to strict scoring caps)
- Strengths: Acknowledge curiosity only
- Improvement: "Point to exact unclear part"
- Examples: Clarifying questions like "Which step wasn't clear?"

### Validation Checks
- Classification accuracy for issue detection
- Score capping enforcement
- Coaching quality and relevance
- Example upgrade appropriateness

## Configuration Options

Environment variables for customization:
```bash
ROGA_STRICT_SCORING=true          # Enforce caps for vague/closed
ROGA_MIN_EXAMPLES=2               # Minimum example upgrades
ROGA_MAX_EXAMPLES=3               # Maximum example upgrades
ROGA_FEEDBACK_MAX_WORDS=120       # Word limit for feedback
```

## API Usage Examples

### Complete Pipeline:
```bash
curl -X POST https://roga-api.fly.dev/daily-challenge-feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scenario_text": "Your teacher explains a project...",
    "user_question": "Wait, what?"
  }'
```

### Individual Steps:
```bash
# Step 1: Classify
curl -X POST https://roga-api.fly.dev/classify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scenario_text": "...", "user_question": "Wait, what?"}'

# Step 2: Coach (using classification result)
curl -X POST https://roga-api.fly.dev/coach \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"scenario_text": "...", "user_question": "...", "classification": {...}}'
```
